## Authors

* [Antonia Mugisa](an235582@dal.ca) - (Developer)
* All code was done and completed by me in this lab. 


## Sources Used

If in completing your lab / assignment / project you used any interpretation of someone else's code, then provide a list of where the code was implemented, how it was implemented, why it was implemented, and how it was modified. See the sections below for more details.


### L7V3-Example.js

*Lines ## 100  - ## 105

```
Copy and paste your code on lines mentioned 

function randomNumber() {

    return Math.random();
}

console.log("Here is a random number:" + randomNumber());

```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [L7V3-Example.js](https://dal.brightspace.com/d2l/le/content/339466/viewContent/4523198/View) as shown below:

```
Copy and paste the snippet of code you are referencing

console.log(Math.random());
// returns a random number
console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10));
// the Math.floor() function is useful to use when we want to work with a whole random number instead of a fractional one, in this case Math.floor() rounds down to the nearest whole number (based on the result from Math.random() * 10
// Math.ceil() rounds up to the nearest whole number, and Math.round() rounds to the nearest whole number

```
